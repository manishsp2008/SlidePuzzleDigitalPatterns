# Product Roadmap

1. [ ] Pattern Data Model & Randomizer — Create the core logic to represent the 4-color grid and generate valid random board states. `S`
2. [ ] Pattern Display Component — Build the responsive UI component to visualize the generated 4-color pattern (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue) resembling the physical cards. `S`
3. [ ] Basic Generation Controls — Implement the "New Card" interaction to trigger the randomizer and update the display. `XS`
4. [ ] Difficulty Logic Engine — Implement algorithms to vary pattern complexity (e.g., number of shuffles, specific symmetry) for Easy vs. Hard modes. `M`
5. [ ] Difficulty Selector UI — Add user controls to toggle between difficulty levels before generating a new pattern. `XS`
6. [ ] Mobile-First Responsive Layout — Optimize the layout to maximize visibility on phones and tablets (simulating a physical card held next to the toy). `S`

> Notes
> - Order items by technical dependencies and product architecture
> - Each item should represent an end-to-end (frontend + backend) functional and testable feature
