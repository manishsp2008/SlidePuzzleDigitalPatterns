# What is the game?
- A slide puzzle board with movable colourful tiles/dots that children slide around.
- Comes with challenge cards showing different patterns or colour arrangements toddlers are encouraged to replicate on the board.
- The board has 4 colors tiles/dots (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue).

# Goal:
- We want to create a digital version of the patterns for the above game. Currently the puzzle provides fixed set of 15 options that can be used by children as puzzle but I want to have a digital version that can generate infinite combination by choosing difficulty levels.
